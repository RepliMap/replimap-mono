# Welcome to RepliMap

**RepliMap** is an AWS Infrastructure Intelligence Engine that reverse-engineers your AWS infrastructure into Terraform code. Visualize dependencies, audit security, and optimize costs in minutes.

<Callout type="info">
  **100% Local Execution:** RepliMap runs entirely on your machine. Your AWS credentials and infrastructure data never leave your environment.
</Callout>

## The Problem

You inherited an AWS account. Or maybe you built it yourself over 3 years of "just one more click."

Now you have:
- **500+ resources** and no idea what connects to what
- **No Terraform** — everything was ClickOps
- **Oversized instances** burning money 24/7
- **SOC2 audit next month** — good luck

## The Solution

RepliMap scans your AWS, builds a dependency graph, and gives you superpowers:

```bash
$ replimap -p prod scan

✓ Scanned 847 resources in 23.4s
✓ Mapped 1,203 dependencies
✓ Found 12 compliance issues
✓ Identified $2,847/month in savings
```
