import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout'

RepliMap is designed with **Sovereignty** and **Security** as core principles. We understand that your infrastructure map is sensitive data.

## Core Principles

### 1. Read-Only Access

RepliMap **only requires read permissions** to your AWS environment. We never:
- Create, modify, or delete AWS resources
- Require write permissions to any service
- Make changes to your infrastructure

### 2. Local Processing

All data processing happens **on your machine**:
- AWS API responses are processed locally
- Terraform code is generated locally
- No infrastructure data is sent to external servers
- All data stored in `~/.replimap/` or your output directory

### 3. No Data Collection

RepliMap does **not collect** your infrastructure data:
- No telemetry of scanned resources
- No upload of generated Terraform code
- No tracking of your AWS resource configurations
- Only license key validation touches our servers

## Data Handling

| Data Type | Accessed | Stored Locally | Sent Externally |
|-----------|----------|----------------|-----------------|
| VPC configurations | ✅ | Optional | ❌ |
| EC2 instance metadata | ✅ | Optional | ❌ |
| Security group rules | ✅ | Optional | ❌ |
| RDS configurations | ✅ | Optional | ❌ |
| S3 bucket metadata | ✅ | Optional | ❌ |
| S3 bucket contents | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Database contents | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Secrets/credentials | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Sensitive Data Protection

### Secret Scrubber

RepliMap includes a built-in **Secret Scrubber** that automatically detects and redacts sensitive data from generated code:

- AWS Access Keys (`AKIA*`, `ASIA*` for STS)
- AWS Secret Access Keys
- Private Keys (RSA, EC, DSA, OpenSSH)
- Database URLs with embedded passwords
- Bearer tokens, API keys
- Generic secrets (`password=`, `api_key=`, etc.)

When secrets are detected:

```
⚠️  Sensitive Data Redacted:
   • AWS Access Key ID: 2 instances
   • Generic Secret: 3 instances

Review generated files. Use Terraform variables for secrets.
```

### Account ID Replacement

AWS account IDs are automatically replaced with variables:

```hcl
# Before
arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:123456789012:vpc/vpc-abc123

# After  
arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:${var.aws_account_id}:vpc/vpc-abc123
```

## Trust Center (Enterprise)

For Enterprise users, RepliMap provides a **Trust Center** audit mode that generates cryptographically signed compliance reports proving all API calls were read-only.

```bash
# Enable Trust Center auditing during scan
replimap scan --profile prod --trust-center

# Generate compliance report
replimap trust-center report
replimap trust-center report --format pdf --output compliance.pdf
```
